## What
This is an improved version of my CSCI130 Web Development project.  

## Why
When I first learned: 
* JavaScript
* HTML
* the DOM
* AJAX
* PHP
* and CSS

I did not know proper software engineering principles.  While I received an 'A' on the project, the code was not well organized or maintainable.  This project is an endeavor to change that, and in addition, to use modern frameworks like:
* React
* Express
* NoSQL

## Design
Model-View-Controller (MVC)
